Script Canvas is a visual scripting environment for Amazon Lumberyard that you can use to create game logic and behaviors\. Integrated with Lumberyard's component entity system and built on AzCore, Script Canvas is designed to use the serialization, reflection, modularization, and EBus messaging systems\. Script Canvas offers an approachable and easy\-to\-read environment to author behaviors using the same framework as Lua and C\+\+\. With its visual scripting options, you can use Script Canvas to create [scripts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#scripts) for game logic without needing to know how to code\. Event\-driven scripts let you produce small scripts that don't require complex logic to maintain states\.

To enable Script Canvas for Lumberyard, you must enable the [Script Canvas](gems-system-gem-script-canvas.md) gem\.

**Sample Levels**  
To help you get started with Script Canvas, the following sample levels are available:
+ For a basic sample level, see [Script Canvas Basic Sample](script-canvas-basic-sample.md)\. The sample uses a tank to fire a projectile at a target\.
+ For a more in\-depth sample level, install the [Project N\.E\.M\.O\.](script-canvas-nemo-sample.md) sample level, which uses a third\-person camera to control a mini sub through an underwater mine field\.
