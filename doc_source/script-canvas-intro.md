Script Canvas is a visual scripting environment for Amazon Lumberyard that you can use to create game logic and behaviors\. Integrated with Lumberyard's component entity system and built on AzCore, Script Canvas is designed to use the serialization, reflection, modularization, and EBus messaging systems\. Script Canvas offers an approachable and easy\-to\-read environment to author behaviors using the same framework as Lua and C\+\+\. With its visual scripting options, you can use Script Canvas to create [scripts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#scripts) for game logic without needing to know how to code\.

To enable Script Canvas for Lumberyard, you must enable the [Script Canvas](gems-system-gem-script-canvas.md) gem\.

For an example level, see [Script Canvas Basic Sample](script-canvas-basic-sample.md)\.

**Note**  
If you are upgrading your project to use Lumberyard 1\.14, you may need to convert your Script Canvas files that were created in Lumberyard 1\.13 or earlier\. For more information, see [Lumberyard 1\.14](lumberyard-migrating-1-14.md)\.
