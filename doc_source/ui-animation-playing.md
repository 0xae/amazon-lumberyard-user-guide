# Playing Animation Sequences<a name="ui-animation-playing"></a>

You can play back the animation in the **Animation Editor** to preview what it will look like in your game\. Playing the animation sequence animates the UI elements in the **UI Editor**\.

**Tip**  
You can also play animations in the **Flow Graph Editor**\. Use the **UI:Sequence:Play** node to play animation sequences in the game from a flow graph\.  
For more information about this flow graph node, see [UI Animation Node](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/ui-animation-nodes.html)\.

**To control playback of animation in the UI Editor**
+ In the **Play** toolbar of the **Animation Editor**, use the **Play**, **Pause**, **Stop**, **Go to start of sequence**, and **Go to end of sequence** buttons\.
