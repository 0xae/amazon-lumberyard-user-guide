# Waf User Settings \(user\_settings\.options\)<a name="waf-files-user-settings"></a>

Global Waf build system settings are specified in the `user_settings.options` file located in the `\_WAF_` subfolder\. This file is automatically generated from the `default_settings.json` file if it does not exist\. Every build that is run will refer to this file to get the option values specific to the builds\. Any of the values can be overridden at a command prompt using **Override Parameter** column value in the table below\. When a value is overridden, it is not updated in the `user_settings.options` file\.

The settings listed below can be modified in the file directly, or through the **Lumberyard WAF Settings** dialog\. To invoke the Settings dialog, enter `show_option_dialog` command into Waf as follows:

```
lmbr_waf show_option_dialog
```

The tabs shown represent each section in the `user_settings.option` file\.
