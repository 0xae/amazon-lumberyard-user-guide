You can use flow graph modules to set up or script your virtual reality game\.

The [Virtual Reality \(VR\) flow graph nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/fg-node-ref-virtual-reality.html) are available for any attached head\-mounted display\.

You can also use [force feedback ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/fg-node-ref-vr-force-feedback.html) to manage haptic feedback for motion controllers\. You can select the device to send force feedback to and enable it to send events to the motion controllers\. The Oculus and OpenVR APIs are configured to respond to force feedback events\.
