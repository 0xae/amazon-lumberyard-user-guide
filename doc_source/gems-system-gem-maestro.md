# Maestro Gem<a name="gems-system-gem-maestro"></a>

The Maestro gem enables Lumberyard's cinematic sequence system\. With the cinematic sequence system, you can create cutscenes for your games with the **Track View** editor and render them as a series of frames and/or a movie in the editor and during gameplay\.
