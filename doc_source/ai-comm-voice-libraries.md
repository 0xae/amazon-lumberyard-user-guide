# Using Voice Libraries for AI Speech<a name="ai-comm-voice-libraries"></a>

Voice Libraries are XML\-based Excel files used to support localized AI agent speech, sub\-titles, and lip\-syncing\. 

The specific voice library file is assigned in the Communication Configurations XML file using the `<AutoGenerateCommunication>` element and associated attributes\. For more information, see [Using the CommConfig Property](ai-comm-config.md)\. 

For each different AI signal, a specific sound file is used that plays a specific sound or speech snippet\. AI agents are assigned a specific voice library file using the **esVoice** property\.
